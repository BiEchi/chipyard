## Working References

### Layer Normalization

In our code, it shows as:

![LayerNormalization](http://jacklovespictures.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2021-07-09-105533.png)

According to our analysis, we gain the formula
$$
Layer\ Normalization(x_i)=\alpha\times\frac{x_i-\mu_L}{\sqrt{\sigma_L^2+\epsilon}}+\beta
$$
Where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\epsilon$ are the super-parameters we deliver to the Layer Normalization Process; $\mu_L$ and $\sigma_L$ are the mean value and standard deviation of the LAYER, and $x_i$ is the value of the $i^{th}$ value of the current layer. To explain in graphs, we have:

![LayerNormalizationDetailed](http://jacklovespictures.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2021-07-09-111223.png)

### Fix `normalization()`

Used `segmented linear` function to substitute the `while` statements.

### Problem With Software-simulated Approach `chipyard-verilator`

Using `spike` software, we do not know how much time clocks it takes for a process. We could only simulate the result (structure).

We used `chipyard-verilator` to transform `chisel` into `verilog`, in order to simulate the time clocks. However, this approach is not exact. The estimated clocks should be 1,600, but the carried-out clocks is 1,300. The `chipyard-verilator` uses `verilator` to transform `chisel` into `verilog`, then run `verilog` on the simulated `SoC-chip` (hardware part). We then used `build.sh` to compile `c` files using `risc-v` (software part). Also, using this approach, the software compilation part is a bit too slow for PCs.

### Switch `chisel` to `verilog`

This process can be found according to `chipyard-document`.

### Read the source code of `gemmini`

Read all the source code files in `/gemmini/src`.



## Gemmini Architecture

In this part, you write about the goals from each component.

### Overall Architechture

![OverallArchitecture](http://jacklovespictures.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2021-08-04-082749.png)

### PE



### Controller

```
	1. In Controller, the rocc instruction from io.cmd will be unrolled, by loopConv function and loopMatMul function, to a machine code to control load,st,ex unit. The unrolled command will be store in the re-order buffer firstly  after being unrolled.
	2. Load,ex,st unit will drive the dma in Spad unit.
	3. The control have busy and interrupt status judgement and signals.
	4. ROB unit as a queue, or buffer, do not relate to the compile process of cmd, so it maybe not be required to change
```

#### The schema of Controller

### PE + Tile + Mesh

```
PEï¼š
	1. the previous PE's out_c port will be connected to the next PE's in_d port according to the chisel code in Tile.scala
	2. PE unit has Mac unit(function) to execute matrix multiplication and addition
	3. Don't know where to store the weight when WS situation
Tile:
	Connect the PE units in series by this form of code, see figure below
Mesh:
	Similar connection logic as Tile Unit
```

#### code of Tile.scala to fulfill the connection in series

### Zero writer

```
	1. A small module that update the value of local address, mask, last according to the req config
	2. function: write 0 into banks
```

![ZeroWriter](http://jacklovespictures.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2021-08-04-082823.png)

### Spad module

1. Io.srams will control the sp_bank directly, and also the io.acc

2. There is a vec_mul unit to calculate vector multiplication and write back to the sp_banks and acc_banks

3. Every reading instruction of sp_banks and acc_banks will feedback the result to writer

4. The function of Reader:

5. The function of Writer:

6. DMA: the interaction between Memory and SpadBankss
